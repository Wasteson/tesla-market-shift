    "text": "• Tesla diverged early. While most EV brands followed a gradual growth curve, Tesla entered and exited its surge phase earlier – suggesting a sharper, brand-specific trajectory.\n• Price sensitivity varies. Most segments showed textbook behavior: as listings increased, prices fell. Tesla, by contrast, remained price-stable – pointing to centralized pricing or brand insulation.\n• Timing overlaps with political signals. The most significant structural shifts in volume occurred around the same time as Musk’s Trump endorsement – not proof of causation, but enough to warrant further scrutiny.\n• Tesla breaks the model. Statistical models fit well for most segments, but Tesla’s higher residual error and flatter price–volume relationship point to episodic behavior and distinct market logic.\n• Implication: Watch Tesla. Real-time monitoring of brand-specific shifts could provide a competitive edge – especially when sentiment and leadership cues drive market volatility."

A dramatic shift is visible from late summer 2024, with electric vehicles leading the surge.\nNote on indexing: The following charts use indexed volumes (Week 1 = 100) to show relative changes over time. This means we are comparing growth patterns – not absolute volumes. For example, Tesla may appear to outpace the EV market, but this reflects faster growth from a smaller base, not a larger total volume.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndexed listing volume: Total vs Fossil vs Electric (Retail only, Index = 100 in April 2024)"

Each point represents one week; the trendlines show the direction and strength of that relationship for each brand. Two visual elements are key here:\nSlope of the line → how prices respond to changes in volume\n\n– A steeper negative slope means prices drop as listings rise (more price-sensitive).\n\n– A flat line indicates prices remain stable regardless of supply.\nLength of the line → the range of observed volumes\n\n– A longer line means that the segment has been listed across a wider range of weekly volumes.\n\n– A shorter line signals that the brand rarely reaches high volumes – so price behavior is only observed within a narrower supply band.\nFindings\n\n– VW ID combines a long line and a steep slope – indicating both high listing activity and strong price sensitivity.\n\n– Skoda Enyaq has a shorter but steep line – fewer weeks with high volume, but still a clear price drop pattern.\n\n– Tesla displays a flat and relatively short line – suggesting stable prices across a narrow volume range, reinforcing earlier signs of centralized pricing or limited responsiveness to weekly market conditions.\nTogether, these patterns reveal that volume alone doesn’t determine pricing power – the brand matters, and Tesla continues to diverge from peers in how it responds to market shifts."

It absorbs volume without discounting – or at least, without obvious market-based pressure.\nTogether, these charts reinforce the central pattern: Tesla doesn’t just behave differently – it prices differently, moves differently, and responds to change on its own terms. For market watchers, that makes it both harder to predict – and more important to watch."
